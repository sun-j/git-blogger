# Git Blogger

Hello world! This is a project that I started based on a new years resolution to learn front-end web dev.

To start this journey, I thought I would actuall build a platform which would serve my blog. For the moment, this project will use git as the database and serve individual posts that are written in markdown.

I understand that there are lots of existing projects that do exactly this, but I am using this as a learning exercise. As I learn more about front-end, hopefully this website will get more pretty.

While I am generally more comfortable in Django, I thought I would use this opportunity to try and learn how Flask works.

Wish me luck!
